2. Inside the second Input text box type a whole number which we use as the percentage. note: no percentage sign necessary. The code in the program at this point does not accept or recognized percent symbols into input text box. 

3. Click the first calculate button to display the tips amount inside the third box.

5. Click the second button, and a split tips amount will the display just above the second button.
